# epgdata

`epgdata` is an R data package that is supplementary to the `EPGminer`
package and needed for the demo vignette. The demo data is included here
as a separate package due to the inherent size of EPG data sets. Please
refer to the `EPGminer` package itself
[here](https://github.com/LylChun/EPGminer) for more discussion of EPG
data and analysis.

## Installation

You can install the `epgdata` package from github as follows.

``` r
if (!require(devtools)){
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("LylChun/epgdata")
```

## Raw EPG data

The `epgdata` package contains 12 hours of raw EPG voltage data from an
example dataset (.txt) along with itâ€™s accompanying manual annotation
file (.ANA) To see how one may analyze this data, please see the
`EPGminer` package [here](https://github.com/LylChun/EPGminer)
